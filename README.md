# TestModWorkflow
Copy the workflow script into your repo, then edit the values of MOD_PROJECT_FOLDER and MOD_PROJECT_FILE appropriately.

Also, make sure to set NEXUSMOD_API_KEY and NEXUSMOD_SESSION_COOKIE as secrets in your repository. You can see how to get the cookie value in the FAQ of this repository: https://github.com/Digitalroot-Valheim/Digitalroot.ModUploader

Also make sure actions have write permissions in your repository if you want to use the tag creation (Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions).
